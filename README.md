## Wedding RSVP Manager

This application allows the user to manage RSVPs to their wedding from a single location. Guests can respond by simply visiting the URL. They will first of all be prompted to login with pre-set credentials. Auth has been handled using [NextAuth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth).

Once logged in, users will arrive on a scrollable home page giving them all the information they need about the wedding.
